# TIMER-CHALLENGE-GAME

⏱️ Timer Challenge Game
Overview
Timer Challenge is a fun and engaging game built with React that puts your internal clock to the test. The objective is simple: try to stop a running timer as close as possible to a set target time — usually 5 seconds — without any visual countdown or time display. As the levels progress and the target time increases, the challenge becomes more intense!

🧠 How It Works
You are given a target time (e.g., 5 seconds).

Click Start to begin the challenge.

Internally, a timer starts counting down in milliseconds.

Try to click Stop as close as possible to the target time.

A Result Modal will display how accurate your reaction was.

You can reset the challenge and try again as many times as you like.
